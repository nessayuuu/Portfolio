        <p class="name-title">Sandra Smith - </p>
        <p>is a single 25 year-old financial analyst. Her interests include finding new food to eat, traveling to find new food and her two dogs. To complement Sandra’s hobbies, her needs include: exploring the world on a budget, and balancing her lifestyle with her expenses. Some of her frustrations include needing to switch between applications and websites to find the best deals, and hours of operations for restaurants. A potential solution is an application that condenses prices for lodging, food, and hours of operation at new locations.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Define.</h3>
                <p>My first step was to define Wanderer’s goals. To define the goals, I created a survey, and conducted user interviews with the younger general public whose age ranged from 22-28 years old. From there I was able to define three goals: narrowing down local locations, providing the most affordable lodging and transportation options.</p>

                <p>The second step was to develop mobile wireframes for user testing. I took responses from both the user surveys and user interviews to locate the most common pain points and design a solution.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">User Test Outcomes.</h3>
                <p>I took the initial wireframes and asked random individuals to test it and provide feedback. Initial reactions were met with confusion as the users were not provided with a clear task. Instead, they had to be walked through to complete the task. Taking a step back, I had to redefine what is a logical workflow for users, not just me as an individual. That took me back to the drawing board where I redesigned the application based on the feedback received from users.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the initial confusion, users immensely enjoyed the idea of collecting three aspects of traveling and placing it into one app to save time, energy and money.

User Research was the largest influencer<br>in iterating my design to better complement the users and not me as the designer. I realized my initial designs<br>were centered around how I saw the flow of actions but not necessarily how everyone else would see it. <br>Learning to let go of my earlier designs and taking the leap into creating a whole new experience<br>for the users was eye-opening in thinking outside the box, outside my world and into everyone else's.
