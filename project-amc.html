        <p class="name-title">Patrick Hendrickson - </p>
        <p>is a single 35 year-old business manager. His hobbies include<br>shiking, camping, climbing and nature photography. To complement Patrick’s hobbies, his needs include: living a sustainable lifestyle, utilizing eco-friendly camping and climbing gear, and discovering new outdoor activities that will challenge his skills. In addition, Patrick does face some frustrations such as poor environmental and animal conservation efforts from organizations, and lack of transparency from those conservation organizations. Despite all this, he wants to continue the effort in volunteering and giving back through other means when time isn’t available to him for an organization that is transparent.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Define.</h3>
                <p>Our first step was to define the goals of AMC’s website. To define the goals, we created a survey, conducted both a stakeholder interview with an employee at AMC and user interviews with the general public. From there we were able to define three goals: donate, volunteer, and be an all-encompassing resource for the Appalachian Mountain Trails. </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Prototype.</h3>
                <p>The next step was to develop website and mobile wireframes for user testing. Our team condensed the navigation bar options to five items: donate, volunteer, join, resources, and contact. Each item would have a dropdown where it would direct either Patrick or Patricia to their desired goal. The website wireframe focused on volunteering while the mobile focused on providing trail resources.</p>

            <div class="column-1" id="column-3">
                <h3 class="subtitle">User Test Outcomes.</h3>
                <p>We took our initial wireframes and asked random individuals to test it and give us feedback. For the website wireframe, there were two major flaws: naming items and vague call to actions. One example of a naming issue is “Volunteer Resources”, we renamed it “Volunteer Opportunities” as many testers found the term resources to be either too vague or mean something else completely. Our testers also encountered issues where they wanted to volunteer, but could not find the button to do so with ease. So our team went back and moved the volunteer button around so it was more easily accessible.<br> 
<br>
                Despite the issues we encountered, most users enjoyed the location feature of volunteering. As the Appalachian Mountain Trail spans 14 states, it can be difficult to narrow down volunteering opportunities for an individual residing in one state.<br>
<br>                        
                For our mobile wireframes, our two major flaws was once again naming items, but also, the order of the dropdown menu. During testing, users couldn’t find where the trail resources were but guessed from process of elimination that “Resources” meant “Trails” at the bottom of the menu. From there, our team eliminated “Resources” from the dropdown menu and replaced it with “Trails” and placed it higher on the dropdown menu. In addition, our users were also confused when they saw the word “Join” on our dropdown menu as it was too vague. Our team re-defined it to “Join the Community” to match our website.</p>
