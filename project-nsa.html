                        The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for collection, counterintelligence, and data processing both domestic and abroad. The NSA is also in charge of protecting the United States communication networks and information systems.

        <p>is a single 27 year-old graduate student. As she’s preparing to graduate from her masters in Criminology and Information Systems she’s looking to build her career. Her interests include watching criminal shows, reading news articles and growing her succulent collection. One of her largest needs is to find a job and discover more about the company that she’s applying for. The biggest obstacle she is facing is finding information on both job postings and the company. Due to the disorganization, she finds herself going onto other sites for the same information. By offering a site with easily accessible information, Charlotte is more willing to continue using the site.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Define.</h3>
                <p>Our first step was to define the NSA’s website goals. To define the goals, I conducted a card sorting activity and red-lining as to way to condense information. From there I was able to define four goals: about the NSA, latest updates from the NSA, join the NSA and NSA resources. This makes up the entirety of the navigation.</p>

                <p>The second step was to develop website wireframes for user testing. I created a basic outline of how the site would work and asked users to test it for viewing current leaders of the NSA and filling out a form for more information.</p>

                <p>I took the initial wireframes then asked random individuals to test the website and mobile version to provide feedback. Initial reactions were met with confusion as users focus was shifted to job postings. It was the largest section of the page and users weren’t able to discern how to find information and fill out a form. Others found the left column of text to be repetitive and information too condensed so the effect was overwhelming.<br>
                <br>
                The first step was to remove the left column of text. The next step was to not place emphasis on job postings for the NSA. By spacing out the information into horizontal sections on the page, I was able to achieve a cleaner and more easily digestible organization of information.
